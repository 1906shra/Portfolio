A portfolio is a curated collection of an individual's work and achievements, designed to showcase their skills, experience, and capabilities to potential employers, clients, or educational institutions. It typically includes an introduction or biography, a resume or CV, samples of work relevant to the individual's field, detailed case studies of specific projects, a summary of skills and expertise, testimonials or references, and contact information. Portfolios can be physical or digital, and they serve as a tool to effectively present one's professional abilities and accomplishments in a structured and compelling way
